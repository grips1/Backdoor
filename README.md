# Backdoor script

Note: I'll be keeping the documentation and progress of my work on this page.

###### Firstly what do I plan to achieve with this project?
I plan on coding a script that creates a connection once executed which provides the client with a cmd shell on the victim's machine (currently only for Windows).
